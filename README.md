# Ransomware Incident Response Plan

## Overview

Ransomware attacks are a serious threat that can disrupt business operations, damage reputations, and compromise sensitive data. The purpose of this document is to outline the steps employees must take in the event of a ransomware attack and how our company will respond to such incidents. Prompt action can minimize the impact and speed up the recovery process.

### What is Ransomware?

Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that encrypts a user's data, making it inaccessible until a ransom is paid. It typically spreads via malicious email attachments, compromised websites, or network vulnerabilities.

## Incident Response Steps

### 1. **Identify the Attack**
   - **Symptoms**: Files or folders become inaccessible, showing file extensions like `.encrypted`, `.locked`, or `.ransom`. You may receive a ransom note on your computer screen or via email.
   - **Signs of Ransomware**:
     - Files suddenly appear locked or with unusual file extensions.
     - Unexpected system slowdowns or crashes.
     - Ransom notes or pop-up messages demanding payment.

### 2. **Immediate Actions**
   If you believe you've been impacted by ransomware, follow these steps immediately:
   
   - **Do not panic**. Stay calm and follow the procedure outlined here.
   - **Disconnect from the Network**: 
     - Unplug your computer from the internet and any networked drives (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, VPN).
     - Disconnect any external storage devices (USB drives, external hard drives).
   - **Do not interact with the ransom note**: Refrain from clicking on any links or following any instructions given in the ransom note.
   - **Inform IT Security**: Immediately report the incident to the IT Security Team via **security@[yourcompanydomain].com** or call **[IT contact number]**.

### 3. **Contain the Attack**
   The IT Security Team will take over the containment process, which includes:
   
   - **Quarantining affected devices**: Isolating the infected system to prevent ransomware from spreading to other networked devices.
   - **Blocking external communication**: Disabling internet and network access to prevent ransomware from reaching out to command-and-control servers.
   - **Access Control**: Ensuring no other accounts or systems are compromised.

### 4. **Eradicate the Threat**
   Once the ransomware is contained, IT will:
   
   - **Run security scans**: Using up-to-date antivirus or anti-malware tools to remove ransomware from infected systems.
   - **Check for backups**: IT will verify whether the latest unencrypted backups are available and intact. In case backups are infected, IT will look for isolated or cloud-based backups that were not impacted.
   - **Rebuild affected systems**: Affected systems will be wiped clean and restored from backup, or in cases where no clean backup is available, a reinstallation of the operating system will occur.

### 5. **Restore and Recover**
   - **Restore from Backup**: If backups are available, IT will restore encrypted files and systems to their most recent unaffected state. Ensure that backup data is free of any ransomware before restoring.
   - **Ensure Systems are Clean**: Before bringing systems back online, IT will confirm they are clean of ransomware and other malicious components.
   - **Monitor Systems**: After restoration, systems will be monitored closely for signs of reinfection or any unusual activity.
   
### 6. **Communication**
   - **Internal Communication**: IT will send a company-wide communication detailing the status of the incident, what actions were taken, and what employees should do next.
   - **External Communication**: If necessary, the company will notify external parties such as vendors, customers, and law enforcement about the breach.
   - **Do Not Pay the Ransom**: Do not pay the ransom. Paying does not guarantee that the data will be restored, and it funds criminal activity. 

### 7. **Investigation and Root Cause Analysis**
   After the immediate threat has been mitigated:
   - **Perform a Forensic Investigation**: Investigate how the ransomware entered the system, whether it was via email, vulnerabilities, or another attack vector.
   - **Identify Weaknesses**: Identify and patch vulnerabilities, update software, and reinforce defenses to prevent similar incidents in the future.
   - **Document the Incident**: Thoroughly document the attack, response actions, and lessons learned. This will help improve future response efforts.

### 8. **Post-Incident Review**
   After the ransomware attack has been resolved:
   - **Conduct a Post-Mortem**: Hold a meeting with relevant stakeholders to review the incident, response actions, and identify areas for improvement in the security posture.
   - **Update the Incident Response Plan**: Based on findings from the review, update the company’s incident response procedures to better prepare for future threats.
   - **Train Employees**: Ensure that all employees receive training on how to identify phishing emails and potential ransomware threats.

## Preventative Measures

To minimize the risk of a ransomware attack, the company employs several proactive security measures:

- **Regular Backups**: Ensure that all critical data is backed up frequently and that backups are tested for reliability.
- **Employee Training**: Regular cybersecurity awareness training for all employees, especially about phishing and social engineering.
- **Patch Management**: Ensure all operating systems, applications, and security software are kept up to date.
- **Endpoint Protection**: Use advanced anti-malware tools to protect all endpoints (computers, servers, mobile devices).
- **Network Segmentation**: Implement network segmentation to limit the spread of ransomware if an attack occurs.
- **Email Filtering**: Use advanced email filtering systems to block malicious attachments and links.
